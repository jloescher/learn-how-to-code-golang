/*
Using goroutines, create an incrementer program
- have a variable to hold the incrementer value
- launch a bunch of goroutines
 - each goroutine should
  - read the incrementer value
   - store it in a new variable
  - yield the processor with runtime.Gosched()
  - increment the new variable
  - write the value in the new variable back to the incrementer variable
use waitgroups to wait for all of your goroutines to finish
the above will create a race condition.
Prove that it is a race condition by using the -race flag
